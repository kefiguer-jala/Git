    <h1>Why Am I Taking This Class?</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I am taking CIT31200 because it is in my CIT degree plan and I plan
             to dive in the cybversecurity field in the future.
            Additionally, I am taking this class to familiarize myself with
            the website design area of IT so that I can have a greater understanding
            on how applications function. I want to expand my IT skills as
                much as possible so I can perform better in the cybersecurity field.
        </p>
